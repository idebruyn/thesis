\subsection{Track reconstruction}

The tracks of charged particles going through the \ac{CMS} tracker are reconstructed with an iterative tracking approach. This is used to cope with the high occupancy and consequently high combinatorics. Additionally, the first iterations search for tracks with less possible combinations, such as tracks with many pixel hits or a high momentum. After every iteration, the hits associated with the found track are removed to reduce the combinatorics. Each iteration consists of four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Seed generation.} In this first step hits are combined into seeds for the subsequent track finding. In the initial iterations pixel triplets are used, then pixel pairs, in order to take gaps or non-working modules into account. Next, mixed pixel/strip triplets are taken, and finally strip-only seeds are used. These additional iterations improve the acceptance in $p_T$ and in displacement with respect to the primary vertex.
 \item \textbf{Track finding}. The seeds are used as starting point for a Kalman filter algorithm. This method extrapolates the seed trajectory outward to the next layer, taking into account potential energy loss and multiple scattering. If compatible hits are found in the next layer, the parameters of the trajectory are updated. This process continues until the outermost layer of the tracking system. Using this method, a given seed can generate multiple tracks, or different tracks can share hits. A trajectory cleaner therefore determines the fraction of hits the tracks have in common and discards the track with the lowest number of hits when there are too many shared hits. If both tracks have the same number of hits, the track with the largest $\chi^2$ value is removed.
 \item \textbf{Track fitting.} The track parameters are then refitted using a Kalman filter and smoother, taking all hits determined in the track finding step into account.
 \item \textbf{Track selection.} Finally, the tracks are selected based on quality requirements, such as the number of layers that have hits, the $\chi^2/$dof, and the distance to a primary vertex. This greatly reduces the fraction of reconstructed tracks that are fake.
\end{enumerate}

The performance of the track reconstruction is excellent, and a high track-finding efficiency is obtained~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014fea} while keeping the rate of fake tracks negligible. The highest tracking efficiency is obtained for muons, which traverse the full detector volume and have an improved momentum resolution due to tracking information from the muon detectors giving a long lever arm. For isolated muons with $p_T$ between 1 and \SI{100}{GeV} the tracking efficiency is higher than 99\% for the entire $\eta$ coverage of the tracker, as can be seen from the left plot in Figure~\ref{fig:eff_eta}. The $p_T$ resolution is about 2-3\% for a muon with $p_T = $ \SI{100}{GeV} up to $|\eta| < 1.6$, but worsens for higher pseudorapidities. Different types of particles interact differently with the detector material. Charged hadrons, for example, are also subject to elastic and inelastic nuclear interactions and have a tracking efficiency of 80-95\% depending on pseudorapidity and transverse momentum, as shown in the right plot of Figure~\ref{fig:eff_eta}.

Finally, the primary vertex is reconstructed from the tracks. Since the collisions happen between bunches of protons, multiple protons will be colliding at the same time. The extra collisions, next to the potentially interesting collision, are referred to as pile-up interactions. The particles generated in these collisions are all detected simultaneously and form a challenge to disentangle them from the particles coming from the to be studied interaction.

The reconstruction is done in 2 steps: first the tracks that appear to originate from the same interaction vertex are clustered, then a fitting procedure computes the vertex parameters and assigns a weight to each associated track, reflecting the probability that it corresponds to the considered vertex. Figure~\ref{fig:PV} shows the reconstruction efficiency and the resolution of the primary vertex. The more tracks, the better the vertex is constrained and thus the better the resolution.

\subsection{Electron and isolated photon reconstruction}
\label{sec:electron_reconstruction}

% A photon candidate is seeded from an ECAL supercluster with ET larger than 10 GeV, with no link to a GSF track.
% The total energy of the collected ECAL clusters is corrected for the energy missed in the process,
% with analytical functions of E and η. These corrections can be as large as 25\% at |η|≈1.5 where the tracker thickness is largest, and at low pT. This corrected energy is assigned to the photons, and the photon direction is taken to be that of the supercluster. The final energy assignment for electrons is obtained from a combination of the corrected ECAL energy with the momentum of the GSF track and the electron direction is chosen to be that of the GSF track. 
% lectron candidates must satisfy additional identification criteria.  Specifically, up to fourteen variables—including the amount of energy radiated off the GSF track, the distance between the GSF track extrapolation to the ECAL entrance and the position of the ECAL seeding cluster, the ratio between the energies gathered in HCAL and ECAL by the track-cluster association process, and the KF and GSF track χ2 and numbers of hits—are combined in BDTs trained separately in the ECAL barrel and endcaps acceptance, and for isolated and nonisolated electrons.
% Photon candidates are retained if they are isolated from other tracks and calorimeter clusters in the event, and if the ECAL cell energy distribution and the ratio between the HCAL and ECAL energies are compatible with those expected from a photon shower.

Electrons are reconstructed using information from both the tracker and the calorimeters. Due to the large amount of material present in the tracker, electrons will emit bremsstrahlung photons, and photons will often convert into $e^+e^-$ pairs, which can again radiate bremsstrahlung photons. The electron and photon reconstruction is therefore very similar.

For electrons, a \ac{GSF} candidate is taken as starting point. This candidate is obtained using 2 different methods to reconstruct the electron track from the hits in the tracker. This track reconstruction should gather all radiated energy from the electron. First, the ECAL-based approach is used, grouping \ac{ECAL} clusters into superclusters. These superclusters collect the energy of the electron and the bremsstrahlung photons in a small $\eta$ window and a large $\phi$ window, taking the bending of the electron in the magnetic field into account. The supercluster energy and position is then used to determine the position of the corresponding hits in the tracker layers. Next, the tracker-based approach is used to reconstruct electrons missed by the ECAL-based method. In this case, all the tracks from the iterative tracking with transverse momentum larger than \SI{2}{GeV} are used. The obtained electron seeds are then used in the specific electron tracking, done by a \ac{GSF} fit, which is more adapted to electrons than the Kalman filter used in the iterative tracking, as it describes the energy loss in each tracker layer. 

The total energy of the accumulated \ac{ECAL} clusters is corrected for the energy that was lost in the process, using analytical functions of the energy and pseudorapidity. The applied corrections can be as large as 25\%, at low transverse momentum and at $|\eta| = 1.5$, where the material density in the tracker is largest. The energy of the electron is then obtained from the energy deposited in the \ac{ECAL} and the momentum of the \ac{GSF} track, while the direction of the electron
